# Fritz!Box exporter for prometheus

Simple and straight forward exporter for AVM Fritz!Box metrics. As of now this has tons of assumptions behind it, so it may or may not work against your Fritz!Box. It has been tested against an AVM Fritz!Box 7590 (DSL). If you have another box and data is missing, please file an issue or PR on GitHub.

## Building and running

### Requirements

* Python >=3.6
* fritzconnection >= 0.6.5
* prometheus-client >= 0.6.0

A requirements.txt file is included with the source. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, preferably inside a virtual environment so your local python packages are not messed up.

### System Service
This exporter can directly be run from a shell. Set the environment vars as describe in the configuration section of this README and run "python3 -m fritzbox_exporter" from the code directory. PRs for systemd unit files will gladly be accepted ;-)

### Docker
The recommended way to run this exporter is from a docker container.
The included Dockerfile will build the exporter using an python:alpine container using python3.

There are also pre-built images ready at: [sealife/fritzbox-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sealife/fritzbox-exporter)

To build execute

```docker build -t fritzbox_exporter:latest .```

from inside the source directory.

To run the resulting image use

```docker run -d --name fritzbox_exporter -p <PORT>:<FRITZ_EXPORTER_PORT> -e FRITZ_USER=<YOUR_FRITZ_USER> -e FRITZ_PASS=<YOUR_FRITZ_PASS> fritzbox_exporter:latest```

Verify correct operation:

```curl localhost:<FRITZ_EXPORTER_PORT>```

python_gc_objects_collected_total{generation="1"} 112.0
python_gc_objects_collected_total{generation="2"} 0.0
# HELP python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total Uncollectable object found during GC
# TYPE python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total counter

python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total{generation="1"} 0.0
python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total{generation="2"} 0.0
...
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done completely via environment vars.

| Env variable | Description | Default |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| FRITZ_HOST   | Hostname or IP where the Fritz!Box can be reached. | fritz.box |
| FRITZ_USER   | Username for authentication | none |
| FRITZ_PASS   | Password for authentication | none |
| FRITZ_EXPORTER_PORT | Listening port for the exporter | 8765 |

You can also bind-mount a `settings.json` at `/app/settings.json` to configure multiple Fritz!Box's at once:

```json
[
  {
    "host": "fritz.box",
    "username": "prometheus",
    "password": "prometheus"
  },
  {
    "host": "192.168.178.20",
    "username": "prometheus",
    "password": "prometheus"
  }
]
```
